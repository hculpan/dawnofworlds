    <section class="action-descriptions text-left">
      <p id="shape-land"><em class="action-title">Shape Land</em>This power directs the creation,
      modification, or erosion of mountains, hills,
      lakes, streams, rivers, forests, jungles, deserts,
      grasslands, tundra, steppes, and other land
      forms. On the game map, this power allows
      the creation of land forms within a 1 inch
      diameter area. Roughly. Using this power
      repeatedly can create whole ranges of
      mountains, inland seas, or vast wastelands.
      Use your imagination, and don't forget a few
      waterfalls. You don't need to take up the
      whole area if you have a fun idea.</p>

      <p id="shape-climate"><em class="action-title">Shape Climate</em>This power directs weather
      patterns that are frequent in a rough 1" area,
      like fog, rain, snow, sun, heat, cold, sleet. You
      may wish to create snowy steppes, or hot
      jungle upon your forests.</p>

      <p id="create-race"><em class="action-title">Create Race</em>This power effects the creation
      of one of the traditional races for player
      characters in your game system, or other
      classic fantasy races. Races and civilizations
      are often interchangeable. You may, for
      example, have more than one race of dwarves,
      each with its own unique civilization and
      government. Consider not only humans, elves,
      dwarves, orcs and trolls, but also dragons,
      halflings, or even leprechauns. At the
      discretion of the game master or would-be
      author, non-traditional races may cost double.
      players may pool points to create any race.
      Each race must be given a starting point in the
      world where they begin to build their
      civilization, (or lack thereof.) Races start
      either neutral, or aligned 1 good or -1 evil. See
      Purify and Corrupt.</p>

      <p id="create-subrace"><em class="action-title">Create Subrace</em>This power is used for the
      creation of splinter groups from an existing
      race. These must arise in territory roughly
      adjacent to their ancestors, and may or may not
      start out getting along with their neighbors.
      Dark elves, deep dwarves, human pirates and
      the like are the subject of this power.</p>

      <p id="command-race"><em class="action-title">Command Race</em>By this power, the priests
      of the gods influence a race to action. Cities
      are founded with this power, but it can be used
      for just about anything. An immortal must
      first establish his presence by creating sects
      within the race before influencing them via
      create order. The creator(s) of the race gets
      this sect automatically. This power may
      be used for starting wars, founding cities,
      making alliances, settling territory, etc. Of
      course, you'll need an army to go to war...</p>

      <p id="command-civ"><em class="action-title">Command City</em>Here, the god directs one
      single city to create something. This can be a
      wonder, wall, school, tower, or the like.
      Armies too are created with this power, though
      any given city may only produce one army in a
      given turn.</p>

      <p id="advance-civ"><em class="action-title">Advance City / Civilization</em>This power
      causes the City or Civilization to gain expert
      knowledge of a given science or magic. These
      might include war magic, healing, warfare,
      steel, weapon smithing, sailboats, writing,
      literacy, engineering, architecture, farming, or
      the like. So long as that city or civilization
      persists, it will always be the greatest in this
      field.</p>

      <p id="purify"><em class="action-title">Purify / Corrupt</em>Here, gods go about
      changing general alignment of a civilization,
      city, or a one inch region of landscape by one
      step per turn. Unless the game master or
      author directs otherwise, there is no limit to
      how far this can go.</p>

      <p id="event"><em class="action-title">Event</em>Through this power come the
      changing of fortunes for an Avatar, Order,
      City, or Civilization. A gold mine may be
      found, a storm at sea may strike a fleet, an
      Avatar may escape death, plague, famine,
      drought may strike, or technologies may be
      lost. These are the great, unplanned winds of
      fortune that blow through the history of the
      world.</p>

      <p id="create-order"><em class="action-title">Create Order</em>By this power, the god creates
      an order of people within a civilization or race.These may include thieves' guilds, religious
      sects (see command race,) orders of knights,
      bands of brigands, pirate ships, etc. These
      orders may last indefinitely or be created for a
      particular purpose, such as the extermination a
      sect or opposing race. It is vital to keep track
      of who created a given order, as the cost to
      command them can vary.</p>

      <p id="command-order"><em class="action-title">Command Order</em>Through this power, the
      god makes an order do something. For
      religious orders or sects, add +10 points if a
      non-creating player commands them. For
      other orders, add +5 points to the cost if a noncreating
      player commands them.</p>

      <p id="create-avatar"><em class="action-title">Create Avatar</em>Through this power, the god
      creates a major figure within the history of the
      world. These may be high priests, dragons,
      warriors, dynasties, or the like. If slain or
      wiped out, they may be resurrected or
      reestablished by the creating player for 5
      points.</p>

      <p id="command-avatar"><em class="action-title">Command Avatar</em>An avatar can perform
      ONE of the following immortal or Many
      Mortal actions (such as leading an army) in a
      turn when commanded. Immortal actions
      which an avatar can perform include:
      Command City, Create Order, Command
      Order, Create City, Corrupt/Purify City, Create
      Race (ONCE) , gather an army. Through the
      use of an avatar, players may for example
      raise two armies in a turn from the same city,
      or execute two commands upon a race.</p>

      <p id="catastrophe"><em class="action-title">Catastrophe</em>By this power, the gods
      express their wrath. From fiery mountains to
      the destruction of avatars, the loss of great
      advancements to the destruction of city walls,
      this power brings ruin upon them all by
      whatever clever mechanism the player can
      imagine. (How will you feel when your avatar
      drowns in a lake of acid?)</p>
